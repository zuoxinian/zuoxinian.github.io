excerpt: 'We review the relationship between mental disorders and atypical brain development from a perspective of normative brain development by surveying the recent progress in the development of brain growth charts, including four aspects on growth chart utility: 1) cohorts, 2) measures, 3) mechanisms, and 4) clinical translations. In doing so, we seek to clarify the challenges and opportunities in charting brain growth, and to promote the application of brain growth charts in clinical practice.'

More than two centuries ago, Count Philibert de Montbeillard drew the first growth chart to monitor his son’s growth of height. A growth chart represents an impressive synthesis of anthropometry, statistical summary and chart design, often conceptualized as a “road to health”, remaining a cornerstone of pediatric healthcare. However, there are no analogous charts available for the human brain growth. Such lack of normative assessment of brain development is particularly relevant to psychiatric disorders, which are increasingly recognized as a consequence of atypical brain development. Advanced by modern neuroimaging technologies, especially the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging, the related measurement theory and large-scale brain-mind cohorts, the brain growth charts are becoming materializable.
