excerpt: 'It is an essential mission for neuroscience to understand the individual differences in brain function. Graph or network theory offer novel methods of network neuroscience to address such a challenge. This article documents optimal strategies on the test-retest reliability of measuring individual differences in intrinsic brain networks of spontaneous activity. The analytical pipelines are identified to optimize for highly reliable, individualized network measurements. These pipelines optimize network metrics for high interindividual variances and low inner-individual variances by defining network nodes with whole-brain parcellations, deriving the connectivity with spontaneous high-frequency slow-band oscillations, constructing brain graphs with topology-based methods for edge filtering, and favoring multilevel or multimodal metrics. These psychometric findings are critical for translating the functional network neuroscience into clinical or other personalized practices requiring neuroimaging markers. '

A rapidly emerging application of network neuroscience in neuroimaging studies has provided useful tools to understand individual differences in intrinsic brain function by mapping spontaneous brain activity, namely intrinsic functional network neuroscience (ifNN). However, the variability of methodologies applied across the ifNN studies—with respect to node definition, edge construction, and graph measurements—makes it difficult to directly compare findings and also challenging for end users to select the optimal strategies for mapping individual differences in brain networks. Here, we aim to provide a benchmark for best ifNN practices by systematically comparing the measurement reliability of individual differences under different ifNN analytical strategies using the test-retest design of the Human Connectome Project. The results uncovered four essential principles to guide ifNN studies: (1) use a whole brain parcellation to define network nodes, including subcortical and cerebellar regions; (2) construct functional networks using spontaneous brain activity in multiple slow bands; and (3) optimize topological economy of networks at individual level; and (4) characterize information flow with specific metrics of integration and segregation. We built an interactive online resource of reliability assessments for future ifNN (https://ibraindata.com/research/ifNN).
