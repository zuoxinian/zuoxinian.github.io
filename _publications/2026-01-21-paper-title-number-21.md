excerpt: 'In our target article "Dark Brain Energy: Toward an Integrative Model of Spontaneous Slow Oscillations", we proposed a three-layer hierarchical framework to model the spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) across six frequency bands to delineate their spectral architecture, functional roles, and neurocognitive basis. We are grateful for the seven insightful commentary articles from colleagues across neuroscience, physics, mathematics, psychology and clinics, which collectively enrich our framework. In this review, we address five key themes emerging from and inspired by these commentaries: (1) the relationship between SSOs and consciousness, (2) the geometric foundations of SSOs, (3) evolutionary, developmental, and metabolic mechanisms of SSOs, (4) mathematical modeling of traveling waves underlying SSOs, and (5) neuroscientific implications for brain-inspired intelligence. We finally integrate these perspectives to refine our original model and outline future research directions. '

In our target article "Dark Brain Energy: Toward an Integrative Model of Spontaneous Slow Oscillations", we proposed a three-layer hierarchical framework to model the spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) across six frequency bands to delineate their spectral architecture, functional roles, and neurocognitive basis. We are grateful for the seven insightful commentary articles from colleagues across neuroscience, physics, mathematics, psychology and clinics, which collectively enrich our framework. In this review, we address five key themes emerging from and inspired by these commentaries: (1) the relationship between SSOs and consciousness, (2) the geometric foundations of SSOs, (3) evolutionary, developmental, and metabolic mechanisms of SSOs, (4) mathematical modeling of traveling waves underlying SSOs, and (5) neuroscientific implications for brain-inspired intelligence.
