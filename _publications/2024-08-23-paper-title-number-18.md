title: "Ventral attention network connectivity is linked to cortical maturation and cognitive ability in childhood"

excerpt: 'The human brain experiences functional changes through childhood and adolescence, shifting from an organizational framework anchored within sensorimotor and visual regions into one that is balanced through interactions with later-maturing aspects of association cortex. Here, we link this profile of functional reorganization to the development of ventral attention network connectivity across independent datasets. We demonstrate that maturational changes in cortical organization link preferentially to within-network connectivity and heightened degree centrality in the ventral attention network, whereas connectivity within network-linked vertices predicts cognitive ability. This connectivity is associated closely with maturational refinement of cortical organization. Children with low ventral attention network connectivity exhibit adolescent-like topographical profiles, suggesting that attentional systems may be relevant in understanding how brain functions are refined across development. These data suggest a role for attention networks in supporting age-dependent shifts in cortical organization and cognition across childhood and adolescence. '

The human brain experiences functional changes through childhood and adolescence, shifting from an organizational framework anchored within sensorimotor and visual regions into one that is balanced through interactions with later-maturing aspects of association cortex. Here, we link this profile of functional reorganization to the development of ventral attention network connectivity across independent datasets. We demonstrate that maturational changes in cortical organization link preferentially to within-network connectivity and heightened degree centrality in the ventral attention network, whereas connectivity within network-linked vertices predicts cognitive ability. This connectivity is associated closely with maturational refinement of cortical organization. Children with low ventral attention network connectivity exhibit adolescent-like topographical profiles, suggesting that attentional systems may be relevant in understanding how brain functions are refined across development. These data suggest a role for attention networks in supporting age-dependent shifts in cortical organization and cognition across childhood and adolescence.
