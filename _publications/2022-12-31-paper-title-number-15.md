excerpt: 'A recent editorial in Nature noted that cognitive neuroscience is at a crossroads where it is a thorny issue to reliably reveal brain-behavior associations. This commentary sketches a big data science way out for cognitive neuroscience, namely population neuroscience. In terms of design, analysis, and interpretations, population neuroscience research takes the design control to an unprecedented level, greatly expands the dimensions of the data analysis space, and paves a paradigm shift for exploring mechanisms on brain-behavior associations.'

Reconsidering the experimental design, data analysis strategies and interpretations in cognitive neuroscience research from the perspective of population science with big data exhibits great potential to break through the limitations of current research practices. The research paradigm of population neuroscience driven by big data not 
only outlines a tantalizing vision that ultimately reveals the mechanisms of interactions between brain, behavior, gene, and environment, but also immediately irrigates small-scale BWAS with the additional intrinsic dimensions and the population information encoded in the normative brain models, allowing us to uncover previously invisible patterns and effects. We believe that population neuroscience will reform the research practices of BWAS and advance cognitive neuroscience.
